# E---Commerce-Inventory-Management-System
A simple C++ E-Commerce Inventory Management System. Users can view products, add to cart, remove from cart, and see order summary. My first C++ project using OOP concepts.
Project Overview
This is my first C++ project, where I built a simple E-Commerce Inventory Management System.
The project allows users to:

View available products

Add products to a shopping cart

Remove products from the cart

View a detailed order summary before placing the order

I created this project to practice my skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Classes, and Vectors in C++.
